		<t id="102">Stock exchanges and market analysts throughout the Commonwealth have been buzzing with rumours and debates over the mysterious Phanon Corporation. Nearly nothing is known about this organization. The source of their significant investment fund and their ultimate purpose are both as mysterious as their origin.

		<t id="112">The final bout of the no holes barred IGF tournament ended today at 5:45am SGT with the defeat of Argon `Ta Shee-Do` grandmaster Nathan Gunner by Shin Zein, the current Split `Pinja` champion after an epic 2 hour, 29 minute match that left many of the spectators in awe. &quot;It was incredible&quot; said Ta Shee-Do enthusiast Michael Kormach, &quot;Most of the time it was just two blurs going at it in the centre but despite the fact that I was tired, hungry, and desperately needed to relieve myself I couldn`t tear my eyes away from the ring...just crazy!&quot;\n\nThe controversial competition, which has been running for seven years now, pits a maximum of two fighters per race against each other in a series of sudden death rounds until a Galactic Champion and Runner Up are determined. Winner is determined by knockout or submission and the final cash prize is substantial. Shin Zein was not available for comment but we were able to speak to a spokesperson for Nathan who claimed, &quot;I have talked to Mr Gunner this morning - he is in good spirits and expects to resume training for the next tournament as soon as he is able to. This is provided that the spine reconstruction surgery goes as planned.&quot; he added.\n\nSpec Harley - Sports Correspondent, GalNet News</t>

		<t id="122">Every year the 5 nations of the known galaxies enter into a good will race. All 5 nations \(Argon, Boron, Teladi, Split and Paranid\) enter a basic level ship which has been stripped down to a standard chassis and driven by solar-sail propulsion. A route is chosen to pass through a number of planetary sectors, normally pirate free. Pirates even keep clear of the race as it draws too much attention to their activities.\n\nSolar sailing, once popular in early space travel is now the sport of Kings and Governments. The winners of the last tournament were the Boron, who are hosting this years`s event. The start of the race will begin at Kingdom End, where the Boron Queen will fire the starting laser cannon.</t>

		<t id="132">Trading in Teladianium with the Boron does have its problems. Apart from the distances involved, the goods themselves are increasingly at greater risk from pirates who are rumoured to be hired by rival factory owners to attack transport ships. Ships that do get through however, bring large profits to their owners. It may be worth investing in some support craft, or purchasing additional weaponry. The profits you gain in success will more than pay for such small investments.\n\nNili Ma - Galaxy Network - GalNet</t>

		<t id="142">The trade in BoGas with the Paranid is a difficult business.

		<t id="161">&quot;What`s With These Pirates?&quot; - Miner shows `concern`</t>
		<t id="162">Take a &quot;space-walk&quot; in any ship and you`re bound to come across space pirates. They fly around as if their activity is legit; slowly and conspicuously. Such bold activity should make anyone wonder why and how they could do such with &quot;all&quot; the Police and government around, which in turn makes them think of how much Police and government vehicles are actually in use.\n\nA miner who just came from a days shift in asteroid-laden, and also home to a pirate base, Ore-Belt questioned an officer as to why there is the base around yet no assaults against it. The officer was &quot;too busy&quot; attending to the shiny new hull of his M6 in his dreams to answer the question. The miner, frustrated at such a lax attitude for the harsh terrain of space made sure he was up by sending a sound pulse to his ship via a squash mine. The miner was spared from imprisonment as he hadn`t harmed him, but now he`s been put on surveillance for any dangerous activity.\n\nPil Mino - Galaxy Network</t>

		<t id="172">A navigator on board the Argon destroyer `Dominator` was arrested today after it was found out he was drunk. After checking the Navcharts the Captain noticed he was on a collision course with the South Gate in Aladna Hill. The navigator`s quarters were later searched and two bottles of Argon whisky was found along with some Spaceweed.\n\nIt is said the Navigator, an ex Goner, had spiritual conflicts. &quot;He will be placed in hospital for rehabilitation as soon as we dock at the shipyard,&quot; said the Captain.\n\nJanit Brena - Galaxy News</t>

		<t id="181">GalNet Special : Weapons at War - Phased Shockwave Generator</t>
		<t id="182">This weapon was developed by a rare alliance between the Teladi and Paranid. It works by sending out a phased package, which reacts and expands, creating a shockwave. This weapon has many uses; one is missile defence, and another is multiple fighter defence. The weapon is quite unique in that it is the first `area affect` weapon to come out on the open market. The Paranid decided to sell this in attempt to boost their poor economy, and it has proven quite a success since its release. The process of building this weapon is a complicated one that requires special machinery.\n\nSafety is also an issue; the prototype station exploded when the main matter-compressor overloaded. Since the incident, the manufacturing process has been adapted with machines taking over most of the dangerous phases of production. The Phased packages are developed in a vacuum at zero gravity. If the package reacts with photon energy - more commonly known as light - the package will start to expand. Another requirement therefore is that the manufacturing process takes place entirely in the dark.\n\nThe energy is then compressed using subspace compression technology, similar to that used within cargo bays. When it expands the energy sends out phased waves that affect both the shields and hull of a vessel. Some pilots have described its effects as, `Being stuck in an Ion Storm`.\n\nJan Polak</t>

		<t id="191">GalNet Special : Weapons at War - Ion Disruptor</t>
		<t id="192">Developed by Boron Scientists this weapon is unlike any weapon encountered. The Ion Disruptor fires a steady stream of ion particles in the direction of a ship. The stream is then ignited. The result is a lightning effect that affects ship systems and shields, whilst leaving the hull relatively untouched.\n\nAlthough this weapon is new, it has undergone extensive testing to make sure it keeps to high Boron standards. Although simple enough to explain how it works, manufacturing the weapon is different matter. It is a complicated process that involves building a device that can create a stream of ionised particles. This in itself is dangerous. The process can be seen in one of the Boron`s Published Documents by Dr. Halilo Wo - &quot;Processes and Functions of the Ion&quot;\n\nJan Polak</t>

		<t id="201">GalNet Special : Weapons at War - The Mass Driver</t>
		<t id="202">This weapon is unique in that it is the only type of non-energy based projectile weapon available. It consists of a rapid feed multi-barrelled cannon that is capable of delivering a large number of small projectiles to its target in a short period of time.\n\nIt inflicts damage not due to the power of individual projectiles but through the large numbers of projectiles delivered. Due to the nature of this weapons ammunition it has almost no effect on a ships shield but instead delivers heavy damage directly to the target`s hull. It also causes very little power drain because all energy requirements are supplied by the ammunition.\n\nCurrently the weapon can only be fitted to Argon and Split ships. The true power of this weapon comes from its ammunition. Each projectile is a self contained unit consisting of the projectile itself, a small armour piercing shell with a micro explosive core encased in a unique crystalline matrix, which allows the shells to pass through ship shields unhindered. This is possible by producing a tiny spatial distortion using the shield`s own energy, and an explosive microcharge designed to propel the shell at high velocity towards its target. This pack contains 200 rounds.\n\nJan Polak</t>

		<t id="211">Riots in Priests Pity</t>
		<t id="212">Demonstrating Paranids, angry at the &quot;Sacred Relic of Hope&quot; being moved from Priest`s Pity to Trinity Sanctum, exploded into violence when Paranid Police forces moved in to restore order to the area. Police forces were driven back by over 13,000 protestors as the scene developed into chaos.\n\nThe protestors later took over the Police station and held the Police forces captive in their own interrogation cells. Emperor Xaar gave orders to send in the 191st Paranid Army Division to quell the angry mob. Camera teams were forced out of the area as the army brought order back to the area. They have been no official reports of casualties and information of exactly how the situation is still unknown and probably always will be.\n\nJanit Brano - Galaxy News</t>

		<t id="221">GalNet Special : Weapons at War - Photon Pulse Cannons</t>
		<t id="222">First Developed by Professor Jo Bydnah of the Argon, the Photon Pulse Cannon is a firm favourite of the Argon Military, who then sold the original designs on to other races. This type of weapon is extremely powerful, and can only be fitted on the larger Capital craft. It works by sending highly charged photon radiation through a series of coils that multiplies the charge, creating a very deadly pulse of radiation. The more powerful versions of this weapon include a super-conducting coil set and a proton filter that makes the weapon more effective against hull and shields.\n\nThe stations that produce them were the original Weapons Research Laboratories that developed this technology for the Argon. Professor Bydnah still works on updating the PPC weapon and has recently become the head of Argon Weapons Research in Omicron Lyrae, representing the Grand Sonra University.\n\nJan Polak</t>

		<t id="231">Thousands dead as asteroid pushed into planet</t>
		<t id="232">The planet Oceania in Menelaus` Paradise is in a state of shock after an asteroid hit by a TL class transporter was sent tumbling into the planet`s atmosphere. The death toll is currently unknown but is thought to number well over 12,000. The gigantic transporter was attempting to set up a silicon mine on a nearby asteroid and nudged the mountain sized rock onto a collision course. The Boron pilot, Fumi No, was tested for narcotics and was found to be under the influence of both Spaceweed and Argon whisky. If found guilty of flying while intoxicated, Fumi No faces a prison sentence of no less than 10 years and his Master`s licence revoked. Critics have protested that the length of sentence available is not severe enough compared to the destruction and loss of life caused.\n\nAid convoys are being sent by the Argon, Goner and other Boron sectors. The Boron government has set up a charity for all affected and all Boron government factories have sent a percentage of their profits to help. Anyone worried about family members who may have been on the planet at the time are advised to contact the administrator of the nearest Boron trading station for details on the latest updates.\n\nThere will be a memorial service held in the Goner Temple in Cloudbase South West. Anyone wishing to attend should contact the Goner for details.\n\nKrimanckussut - Current Affairs Correspondent, GalNet News</t>

		<t id="241">Competing Pirate groups cause havoc in Frontier Sectors</t>
		<t id="242">Reports have been coming in about rival pirate groups setting up competitions between themselves. The recent spate of thefts, ship hijackings, and smuggling incidents has led to major Police investigations which have revealed that the pirate groups are ranking themselves in a league table format. This league table seems to be split into two sections. The first of these sections involves speed records for various activities including the top times for completing gate races, quickest ship hijacking and fastest escape from Police attention. The other section relates to the amount of credits gained from certain activities. Examples include the highest price for a single smuggling run of contraband products or the highest price for the sale of a stolen ship.\n\nA copy of the &quot;high credits&quot; section of the leader board was recently obtained by Argon military forces in a raid on the pirate base in the sector Ore Belt. The list was a major find and has been used in bringing over 20 pirates to justice. More of the criminals are still being hunted but the Argon are confident that when they are found, the criminals will be convicted by the compelling evidence against them. Tomes Burnett, a spokesperson for the Argon military said &quot;These criminals must be stopped. Not only are they breaking the law, they are making a game out of it. It is a blatant insult to law enforcers of every race as well as to all law abiding citizens throughout the known systems. This cannot and will not be tolerated.&quot; He then went on to remind all individuals that financial rewards are offered to any sentient being who helps to reduce the pirate problem, provided that they are in possession of a Police licence.\n\nKunklu Ni - Legal Correspondent, GalNet News</t>

		<t id="251">GalNet Special : Weapons at War - Particle Accelerator Cannon</t>
		<t id="252">This weapon is usually found on larger fighter craft, destroyers and on some battleships and carriers.\nThey have been around since the Argon Weapons Society was founded near the beginning of the Xenon conflict. The first of its class were developed when the Paranid and Argon were friends and both governments were focused on developing a weapon more powerful than those they currently had in service.\n\nA particle accelerator was entered into the standard laser to try to increase the speed of the weapon`s output. The results were amazing an almost 200% increase in output. The PAC was born. The particles are accelerated to two thirds the speed of light. At that point they are then polarised and focused into a tight energy pulse.\n\nThe effect can be quite devastating, especially to a target ship`s hull. A direct hit has been known to actually dent hull plating.\nOver the years, the PAC has evolved into three types, the Alpha, Beta and Gamma. Each one has a slight modification to the polarisation and focusing of the particles.\n\nJan Polak</t>

		<t id="261">Station races spread to the Teladi and Split</t>
		<t id="262">The outlawed game Station Racing has spread from Argon space to Teladi space and now also involves the Split. The dangerous game involves an agreement on the award and then the station to land on. The Argon are believed to just like the rush of the race, the Teladi just like the gambling for credits and the Split like the danger and being able to embarrass the loser.\n\nNo casualties in the Teladi and Split sectors yet but in Argon space there have been many deaths when station doors have not opened quickly enough for the ship. New laws are being discussed by all three races to keep the space around stations free from these daredevils.\n\nOmon Misar - Culture Correspondent, GalNet News</t>

		<t id="271">Are they still with us?</t>
		<t id="272">Goner scientists today are once again on the hunt to determine if a pile of rocks spotted on a moon in the Montalaar system is of alien origin. Sources from the Goner temple say that they have every reason to now believe that there may have once been activity on the moon. This comes after many years of denying such a claim since the failed expedition several years ago when the noted Professor Autland went missing whilst in transit to the earlier site.\n\nSo get those space-picks out and start digging! let us know what you find!\n\nJako Seldon - Current Affairs Correspondent, GalNet News</t>

Currently digging on a sandy moon they cannot quite decide if it is a Xenon artefact or a lump of rock. We have bets on that it is a rock, what do you think?\n\nIt gives us at GalNet another good laugh to witness another mess-up by these people that are supposed to be leading scientists.

		<t id="292">So far details are sketchy but the Goner science team definitely think they have hit the jackpot.

		<t id="381">GalNet Special : Weapons at War - High Energy Plasma Throwers</t>
		<t id="382">This is a deadly weapon found on some fighter craft and on all destroyers and carrier craft. The radiation is so dangerous that the weapon had to go through many years of research and development until it could be placed on the open market. A major drawback of earlier models being when the weapon was fired a large build-up of plasma remained in the weapons main firing zone. When firing a second time this plasma would ignite causing a large fireball, destroying the craft it was on.\n\nThis was originally resolved by adding a plasma sink into the weapons main design, purging the weapon of all excess plasma between shots. A now famous Paranid Scientist, LarkElSung, developed this technology however it has since been made obsolete. In 420 an alternative was added to this weapon to replace the plasma sink, a Boron biological plasma filter. The regenerative properties of the Boron technology mean that this filter never needs replacing.\n\nToday HEPT`s as they are now known, are invaluable. They can only be used on larger fighters. Any M3 fitted with any of the derivatives of the HEPT is indeed a very powerful craft. As with all technology, new weapons are coming out all the time, who knows one day the HEPT could look like a Split child`s toy.\n\nJan Polak</t>

They require very little power to fire, and they have a rapid recharge rate.\n\nToday IRE weapons are considered to be of the least desired weapons as they have little or no affect on modern high powered shields such as the 25MJ or the 125MJ shield. But against fighters of the Scout class they are extremely valuable.\n\nArgon and Teladi Scientists keep studying new ways of expanding the technological uses of the IRE weapon, although there is very little that can be done to further this technology. It is expected that in the next few years IRE weapons will be taken off the market as power generator technology means that PAC weapons could be fitted to M5 craft.\n\nCould the day of using IRE weapons to cut the Celebratory Argnu be here? Who knows!\n\nJan Polak</t>

		<t id="432">Space Flies are not as common as they used to be in the systems around Split Space. Isolated colonies still exist and in order that the Markus SpaceFly is not hunted to extinction, a group of scientists have started to clone them. Success may one day remove the need to capture such animals in deep space. Cloned production could elevate the high Split demand for such creatures. Conservation work in this area is also being carried out by the Argon and Boron, they both have experience of re-stocking of their seas with new stocks of fish, but their motivation is to protect the Space Fly, a unique species that flourishes in the depths of deep space.</t>

		<t id="442">Argon and Boron scientists are to collaborate on a new long range probe in an attempt to open up more and more of the universe for colonization. It is thought that the mysterious Goner sect is involved in the project but this is not confirmed. If it is true, the probe will probably use the latest jump drive technology in a bid to discover more sectors that can be connected to the existing network.\n\nWhile conventional colonisation has proceeded apace in recent years, there are problems as more and more potential flashpoints between the various governments are created. It is thought the planned probe will not be ready for some months, if not years, and news of its progress will, in any case, be kept strictly secret.\n\nGalNet only learned of the plan through sources connected with one of the science institutes involved in the scheme. Naturally we will not divulge details but GalNet deplores the secrecy surrounding a project that could have implications for all races.\n\nYnojygeos Gossojdraes Alylais I - Science Correspondent, GalNet News</t>

		<t id="451">Call for All Races Archaeology Conference</t>
		<t id="452">Following discoveries across the known sectors, ranging from evidence of prehistoric proto-species to indications of widespread ancient civilisations, a number of eminent archaeologists and historians have called for a conference of all races` experts to discuss the findings. The idea is only at the proposal stage and is sure to encounter many difficulties, not least where to find a neutral venue at which to hold such a conference. However, the notion has the backing of the Boron, Argon and the Goners. It has even gained the support of one noted Paranid archaeologist, Priest-Historian Losadtimanckit.\n\nHowever, an official response to the idea from the Paranid Imperial Antiquities Section has not yet been received. The Teladi Profit Guild has an extensive ancient artefacts programme but this seems more dedicated to selling such items rather than studying them. Split find archaeology almost incomprehensible and they have but a few isolated experts. Speaking out, Priest-Historian Losadtimanckit said: &quot;I have petitioned the Priest Dukes on this matter and I feel sure they will acknowledge the wisdom of sharing knowledge of the past. Naturally I must be bound by their interpretation of the sacred texts and so while I support the idea I cannot yet say if I will be there.&quot;\n\nLeading proponent of the idea, Professor Daka Ro of the Royal Boron Archaeological Survey said: &quot;It would be a shame that a scholar of Priest Historian Losadtimanckit`s calibre could not attend the conference. I feel sure we will find a way to hold this important event.&quot;\n\nYnojygeos Gossojdraes Alylais I - Science Correspondent, GalNet News</t>

		<t id="461">Concerns Over Security at Weapons Facilities</t>
		<t id="462">With the wide dispersal of weapons and shielding factories throughout the known universe, concern is growing that security may be overstretched. Most governments have allowed private corporations to take responsibility for the production of beam weapons and missile technology and even some of the new weaponry developments are being put into production in potentially vulnerable remote sectors. While all such facilities have their own security forces, there is a real danger that opportunistic raiders could attack in force and seize large quantities of very powerful missiles and energy cannons.\n\nWhile governments are unhappy at the situation, most say there is no alternative to dispersed production if efficient distribution of weapons is to be maintained. They also point to the need to ensure resources for their factories are within easy reach. Teladi Profit Guild official Etofomeos Ilalios Ulylues VIII said: &quot;There is a need to balance practicality with security. Not to mention profit.&quot; Argon Federation Admiral Homer Anselm commented: &quot;We need our weapons where we can get at them. If this means that others may be able to get at them we will have to deal with that situation. With crushing force if need be.&quot;\n\nOberon Kallan - Security Correspondent, GalNet News</t>

		<t id="472">Boron authorities have declared a recent spate of exploding BoFu cubes is a bizarre practical joke. Food companies across space have been complaining of BoFu exploding into shreds when the containers are opened. Somehow an excess of Boron BoGas appears to have been introduced into the cubed BoFu and this produces the explosion when the lids are popped.\n\nQuite why somebody would play such a joke on the Boron BoFu industry is a mystery but it follows a pattern of similar strange incidents. The Teladi Nostrop Oil corporations were recently plagued by highly carbonated Nostrop being introduced into their product lines. The resulting &quot;fizzy Nostrop&quot; is said to have coated many Teladi with oil from head to foot. One Nostrop producer has gone so far as to offer a bounty for the head of the responsible party.\n\nElsewhere, the Paranid have discovered several consignments of rubber Soja Husks and the Argon have found Cahoona Steaks that &quot;moo&quot; at anyone trying to cut them up. These latter were found to have been implanted with miniature sound chips. There are no reports of such pranks being played on the Split, though their Rastar Oil Producers Council recently held an emergency meeting.\n\nDaka Ra - Business Correspondent, GalNet News</t>

		<t id="481">Illegal Trade Market May Rival Trade in Legal Goods</t>
		<t id="482">It is being suggested by some security and business sources that the trade in illegal goods may rival that in legitimate commodities on a per credit calculation. Dealing in prohibited alcohol and drugs, outlawed weapons systems and even the scourge of slavery have long been regarded as a problem by some governments, notably the Argon Federation and the Boron Kingdom.\n\nOther governments regard the issues with greater flexibility, the Paranid having no scruples when it comes to weaponry and the Teladi quite openly tolerating the drugs trade. In addition, the Split dependence on slave labour means that this evil market is ever a source of profit for those willing to engage in the trade.\n\nThere are large profits to be made by those willing to risk the wrath of governments that frown on such trading. The penalties can be severe and slavers, in particular, should be warned that the Argon and Boron will not look kindly on their business. Trading in illegal goods can be profitable, but so too can the trade in legitimate ones. Technology and valuable foodstuffs will bring good, safe and legal profits to all who deal in them. As ever, the trader must choose between speed and danger or steady profit and safety.\n\nDaka Ra - Business Correspondent, GalNet News</t>

		<t id="492">The level of kidnappings and hostage taking has risen by some 52% in the last year, according to security group Free Company Associates. The Argon based licensed security and mercenary organisation believes that pirates and illegal mercenary groups have found kidnapping and ransoming to be a particularly lucrative business. This terrible activity has increased far more quickly than the still steadily rising drug trade.\n\nFree Company spokesperson Wilhelm Uhlan said: &quot;Kidnapping is a relatively easy business for an experienced pirate. They pounce on an unsuspecting trader or small passenger ship. They send off demands. Those that get paid for they release, those that don`t they sell into slavery. They can`t help but make credits.&quot;\n\nFree Company Associates believes the answer is to increase licensing of private security organisations so as to plug the gaps in the overstretched governmental and Police fleets. Others fear that such a move would flood space with heavily armed flotillas under no central control. As pirate activity increases it is a problem to which a solution must be found, fast.\n\nOberon Kallan - Security Correspondent, GalNet News</t>

		<t id="512">With the rising popularity of many sports and their major events, the transport of passengers from outer or foreign worlds to the centres of particular sports is on the up and up. The popular Argon sport of Hardball has gained a considerable following among Boron and Teladi and they are joining those travelling from Argon outer worlds to the centres of this sport. The influx of tourists to Ringo Moon, spiritual home of Hard Ball, is particularly striking.\n\nThe Teladi gambling games of Roulestar and Teladi Eye are also attracting much tourism and there are dedicated gambling cruises between various famous Teladi casinos. Gamblers from all races are spending their hard earned credits in this way. Even the Split, who normally restricted themselves to betting on Ghok Deathmatches, have caught the bug.\n\nThen there is Ghok Deathmatching itself. Bizarrely this seems to have created a bridge between the Argon and the Split. Certainly some Argon, perhaps not the most reputable of characters, are taking the time to travel to major Ghok events.

		<t id="522">Recent developments in weapons and shields have seen many new factories established throughout space at a considerable investment cost to the large military hardware producers. Fortunately, this investment appears to have paid off and the need for larger military forces, as the colonies expand, and the increase in armed civilian traffic is resulting in profit for all concerned.\n\nWhile many new weapons systems are still relatively restricted, a number can be purchased and fitted to appropriate craft. It is noticeable that the ship market has also risen and with it demand for shields and basic fittings such as boost equipment, trading extensions and other essentials of civilian spaceflight. The wilder sectors are certainly seeing an influx of weaponry and armed spacecraft.

A number of major players in the food distribution industry have acknowledged that they do not have the capacity to meet all demand and that much work exists for freelance traders and small cargo-carrier outfits.\n\nThe effects of this trend have even been seen in the relatively conservative station building sector, with demand for agricultural facilities and processing factories rising steadily.

		<t id="542">Several recent incidents have resulted in seven people dead, over two hundred injured and minor damage to factories in Teladi and Split space. These incidents have brought to light a new threat from supposedly captured Xenon fighters. They involve captured Xenon ships reactivating and ramming stations when docking requests have been made. Studies of the wreckage of these fighters have revealed dormant memory cores in the fighters which activated under certain circumstances and execute hidden programming causing the kamikaze attacks.\n\nA team of Argon and Boron scientists have been working hard to find a solution to this problem. Spokesperson York Selek has told us that all stations will be provided with the solution and will load it onto every ship. The package is a small memory wipe programme that will be broadcast to any captured ship the first time pilots access the onboard computer. The programme works automatically through the communication system and no extra effort will be necessary by the capturing pilot. All current privately owned Xenon ships that have already docked have been memory wiped by station technicians and while there is no further threat from this type of attack, pilots are asked to remain vigilant for other forms of Xenon trickery.\n\nFunfi Hu - Military Correspondent, GalNet News</t>

		<t id="562">It was confirmed this week that the Goner labs are working on new technology which would render the capture of one of their ships pointless. In very early stages of development, this technology would link each ship to the DNA of its pilot. Upon ejection from the craft, the Goner vessel would effectively shutdown. Cargo space would be uncompressed, rendering the ship useless for carrying cargo, and further engine tunings and rudder tunings would not be possible. A new reaction system would also eject vital parts of the ship out along with the pilot, such as shields and navigation systems, thus hopefully bringing the attack to the attention of the local law enforcement ships. Whilst not perfect, as the ship could still be captured and sold, the improvements are welcome. The bad news for Goner pilots is that this technology is still many years away from being available.\n\nYnojygeos Gossojdraes Alylais I - Science Correspondent, GalNet News</t>

		<t id="781">Lineage Evolution - The Argon Titan</t>
		<t id="782">Since it was first constructed, the Argon Titan has seen a great many changes.\n\nTitan Mk-I was the longest serving ship of its kind. A smaller craft armed with 18 lasers and the then newly developed 125MJ shields. It came into service during the Xenon Conflict replacing the Argon Century as the main battleship. The Century was later decommissioned as it was not powerful enough to cope with the demands of modern combat. The reign of the Titan continued for many years until the Argon government took on a radical new design. Longer than the Mk-I Titan, the Mk-II Titan reminded people of Boron submarine craft. The design of the ship took many people by surprise, it was not like any other ship design to date.\n\nThe Mk-III is the latest design. More advanced technologies were used when constructing this vessel, and the Titan Mk-III was born. Its original purpose was to be an explorer ship as new jump gates were being found. But the Mk-II design was showing its age. The length of the ship meant it was hard to manoeuvre. Poor forward velocity also made this problem worse. The rate of turn was so bad that it earned a nickname of &quot;Old Argnu&quot; as it was said that it was easier to steer a cow.\n\nMk-III is much improved. It is the current favourite with many Argon Captains, although some still wish they could fly the much older Mk-I Titan and Century Craft their ancestors piloted.\n\n&quot;Argon Titan.&quot;\nTomes Nedley</t>

This account has been emptied and is believed closed several days ago. While a number of investors have been left with big losses from what now appears to have been a carefully orchestrated swindle, the biggest loser is Teladi amateur Roulestar champion Gradias Hilibis Trantaeos IV.\n\nIt is believed the ace gambler put the greater part of a 15 million credit fortune into the venture and that this has all been lost. The tragedy for Trantaeos is all the more poignant given that she recently tripled her fortune from 5 million credits after a remarkable run of luck in Teladi casinos. The mystery for some is why Trantaeos would invest her money in such a mundane venture as a mining operation. Some in Treasure Chest whisper that the Teladi was caught up in a variation on the old and well-known Nividium asteroid scam. Trantaeos vehemently denies any such suggestion and has insisted that this is a case of simple financial malpractice. The gambler and erstwhile millionaire has filed with the Teladi Profit Guild but is unlikely to gain anything from it as they have no jurisdiction in Treasure Chest sector.\n\nHack Seldon - Social Affairs Correspondent, IBC News</t>

		<t id="1102">Five Argon TS class ships were recently stopped in Argon Prime for searches. The vessels tried to talk themselves out of a freight scan but by the time they had finished arguing, it had already been completed. Each ship`s whole cargo bay was found to be full of Spaceweed.\n\nBan Burnett, the pilot of the lead TS ship flew towards the Police ships in an effort to break the blockade, the collision killed two Argon Police officers. The convoy then turned towards the south gate and escaped. They were spotted moving towards the pirate base in Ore Belt. These ships are probably now armed and are to be considered dangerous.\n\nOtto Bislar - Culture Correspondent, IBC News</t>

		<t id="1112">Jak Yerly is to be commended for acts of bravery in the service of the Argon military. A senior politician, Getling Wilde will present him with the Medal of Valour tomorrow on Argon Prime.\n\nJak Yerly was in the 15th Platoon in Ore belt when his unit was attacked by five Pirate Orinocos, two Bayamons and a Pirate TS. The seven M4 Argon ships were quickly outnumbered. Jak ordered to fire on the pirate TS first, the combined force of the seven ships made easy work of bringing down the shields. One Argon Buster was lost when all pirate ships fired upon it.\n\nJak was able to get the two Bayamon fighters to chase him through the belt and into a hollow asteroid. Deft handling allowed him to fit his ship through a tight gap and away to safety; the Bayamon pilots weren`t so lucky and were destroyed. The rest of the ships were able to outrun the Orinocos and also made their way to safety. If Jak Yerly had fought the pirates head-on, all the Argon would have perished. The military have promoted Jak to Commander due to his many acts of bravery and quick thinking throughout his service.\n\nTomes Nedley - Documentary Writer, IBC News</t>

One concept that was on show by the first year students, was a device that blocks missiles` targeting sensors, hence allowing for an Anti Missile Defence System. Another idea, was an ingenious robot that crawled along the hulls of large destroyers and carriers, repairing any damage done to the ship.\n\n&quot;I myself am going to take part in this program, teaching what I know to these students,&quot; said Professor Bydnah, who is responsible for some of the Argon military`s most recent weapon technologies.&quot; And who knows, we may have an important development made in this very program.&quot;\n\nHanes Gisller - Science Correspondent, IBC News</t>

This was disrupted by the explosion, which killed 34 people including the station`s Goner priest.\n\nThe station was immediately shut down and ships that had left within the previous four hours were traced; all pilots are being thoroughly questioned. &quot;I was shocked when I was stopped,&quot; said Pilot Pau Semek, &quot;To think I was on the station less than a few hours beforehand.&quot;\n\nIt is thought that the terrorists are part of the Circle Liberation Group who have been terrorising Argon positions in the sector for some time.

		<t id="1152">Serious fires are raging out of control across the eastern continent of Nyana`s Planet in Nyana`s Hideout system. It is reported that there have been a number of fatalities. The eastern continent is extensively settled by small but widely dispersed village and town communities. The continent is heavily wooded and provides lumber for the rest of the planet as well as specialist and exotic woods for the architectural and art materials trade. A burgeoning tourist economy has also been an increasingly valuable secondary industry in the region. All this is now threatened by massive flame-fronts extending over wide swathes of countryside.\n\nDisaster control authorities on the planet say that they simply do not have the resources to put the fires out and are concentrating on protecting settlements. It is hoped the fires will burn themselves out but the cost will be enormous. There is already talk of arson and sabotage with rumours of off-world visitors setting fires deliberately. Some have suggested that a foreign power is behind the fires and one direct accusation is against the Paranid. The suggestion here is that some particularly fine woods threatened the trade of inlaid majaglit furniture and other items. The Paranid government has flatly denied the accusation.\n\nHack Seldon - Social Affairs Correspondent, IBC News</t>

		<t id="1191">New research centre established</t>
		<t id="1192">After a long period of preparation, Goner engineers have finally established a new research centre dedicated only for jump drive studies. The location is highly classified, however rumour tells us that it is set up in close vicinity to Cloudbase South West, somewhere outside the main system area. Other rumours tell us also that the station has its own system drive, allowing it to fly freely in vicinity of the system. Officially no one has been confirmed having visited this station yet, quite probably because it is not marked on any maps. On the other hand even if anyone does manage to find it he probably will not be allowed to dock. A large number of laser turrets are armed to take out every ship approaching without permission.\n\nThe main goal of establishing this centre is to find weak points in jump drive construction and eliminate them, as well as to find new advantages that will improve the use of this drive. It could be, for example, a way to lower fuel cell consumption or even to jump without the use of energy cells. Another topic could be to improve the programming system which is used by the autopilot for setting the auto-jump sequence where there are no crew on board. This drive sometimes has been known to cause malfunctions where the ship using it would jump out near super-novae or the black holes.\n\nIon Gren - Science Correspondent, IBC News</t>

However analysts assume that these actions have been made with the purpose of forcing the Argon government into an offer of compromise: the pirates stopping the attacks only if their leader is released. At present the damage sustained from the recent string of attacks has reached 25 million Credits.\n\nThe politics of government dictates that the Argon do not negotiate with terrorists. &quot;Any negotiations with pirates will be conducted from the end of a high yield plasma thrower&quot; a high ranking official asserted, wishing to remain anonymous until the dispute had been resolved.\n\nHack Seldon - Social Affairs Correspondent, IBC News</t>

		<t id="1221">Special safety measures on Argon space stations</t>
		<t id="1222">After an unfortunate accident which took place inside the docks of the Argon shipyard in Argon Prime, the local authorities have decided to improve the station`s safety measures. Two small pirate vessels moved directly into the path of an incoming trader ship as it passed through a gate, then following it inside the station, they murdered the trader and successfully avoided defence measures by taking out the main power supply generators.\n\nThis action left the dock unprotected for only a few minutes. Unfortunately it was enough time to choose from one of the many docked ships with potentially valuable cargo inside and take it out. The &quot;Bringer of life&quot;, a `Lifter` type transport, owned by Jo Jovi, was blasted open in a moment. Fortunately the trader was not inside. Pirates then collected as much the remaining goods as they could and, destroying the main doors with rockets from inside, moved out the station. Using jump drive units they easily escaped with the booty.\n\n&quot;This unbelievable action is a shame for all Police forces stationed in this system,&quot; stated the Argon Minister of Defence, announcing also that those who didn`t fulfil their duties would be severely punished. &quot;We cannot allow for such actions in the future,&quot; he continued &quot;and we have decided to assign a special fund for all necessary improvements, which will help Federal Argon stations to feel safe from pirate activity&quot;.

The results of this step have been a dramatic reduction in the concentration of armed forces in the central areas of Argon Prime.\n\nThis reduction of Argon forces apparently gave pirates enough encouragement to attack a station which Yahondras Yayasisos Keppel, their pirate clan`s leader, had been transferred to. After a short but fierce fight that took the lives of seven magnificent Argon pilots and fifteen pirates, Yahondras Yayasisos Keppel was eventually recovered by one of his henchmen, storming the station.

		<t id="1262">The Boron Royal Fleet has begun its first recruitment drive in three decades.\n\nIn an interview with RCN, Admiral Gamo Vil stated that &quot;the growing threat from pirates and other races has forced the military to seriously re-think their needs. &quot; The call has gone out to any Boron between the ages of 18 and 30 and Admiral Vil says that the Fleet hopes to attract at least 50,000 new recruits. This would be the single biggest recruitment in the history of our military.\n\nIt is still not clear how the Fleet plans to use these new recruits or how they will accommodate them. Recent appropriations have been heavily focused on upgrading Boron weaponry, not on building more ships or training installations. This has led to rumours that our leaders have been forced into an emergency recruitment drive for reasons they are not prepared to share with the public. A group of representatives in the Commonwealth Assembly plan to raise the issue at the earliest opportunity.\n\nIn a related move, it is rumoured that the Boron Secret Service is actively looking for independent pilots to carry out covert missions.

		<t id="1312">Rumours are flying faster than Octopuses in the bars of Boron space this week after mysterious attacks on shipping lanes at the very heart of Boron space. A spate of attacks in and around Queen`s Space is causing a lot of talk and even more nervousness amongst Boron traders.\n\nOnly one pilot, having survived the attacks, was too shaken to give a coherent report. The only words to have come from Hago Bli`s mouth have been &quot;like vicious wolves&quot; and &quot;never saw them coming&quot;. He was one of the pilots doing the standard Nostrop Oil run between CEO`s Buckzoid and Kingdom End when their convoy was attacked. All the freighters and escorts, including five Boron Eels, were blown to so much space dust. Miraculously, the attackers did not spot Bli who seems to have ejected rather more quickly than his colleagues. No one knows whether the other pilots were taken for slaves or brutally killed in space.\n\nTraditionally, the sectors close to Kingdom End have been relatively free of pirate and mercenary activity. Rumours point to a band of renegade pirates, possibly supported by one of the more warlike races. There are even those who suggest help from beyond known space, given the amazing effectiveness of these attacks. Pilots running these routes are warned to take extra care, and wingmen if they can afford them.\n\nBabu Di - Foreign Affairs Correspondent, RCN News</t>

The total capacity of the ordered TL class ships is sufficient to supply several sectors needs at once raising the fear of a trade war. A mitigating factor is the delivery time required for each ship, but with shipyards working overtime to fulfil orders, and with more orders anticipated it is unclear what the outcome will be.\n\nAnother factor that is of concern to Boron traders is the fact that according to manufacturing logs, virtually all TL class ships have had maximum cargo capacity upgrades specified as standard. While it is commonplace for traders to work their way up to such capacity over a period of time, the immediate order of full capacity TL ships is causing even greater tension.\n\nBabu Di - Foreign Affairs Correspondent, RCN News</t>

		<t id="1472">The Split today finally decided to become the last race to ban space vehicle exhaust additives. Banned everywhere else in the universe, even by pirates, exhaust additives allow the pilot to change the colour of the exhaust gas flare on his craft. The Split used them recently only for exciting displays at weddings, \(which some Boron will know, can be quite exotic\). The ban came about after well-known wedding entertainer Na t`Knt created a new multi-colour additive, complete with explosions and other pyrotechnics. Unfortunately Na t`Knt misjudged the quantities, and the resulting explosion led to his ship impacting on the local trading station in Rhonkar`s Fire amid a quite spectacular and colourful death. It is reported that the wedding guests were nevertheless satisfied with the display.\n\nBabu Di - Foreign Affairs Correspondent, RCN News</t>

		<t id="1482">After hot disputes lasting many months, the debate concerning advertising space on factories has now been settled. Seizing on an idea from the Teladi, Boron factory owners had fought for the right to be able to advertise products, wares and services other than their own on the illuminated station logo boards. The Boron government were against this idea, believing that foreign traders in the sectors would then not know exactly what the station was selling, particularly as other races often comment that all Boron stations look similar already. The factory owners argued that as they legally owned the stations, they could do whatever they wished with them. The deciding factor came when the Teladi advertising agency holding all the new advertising contracts went into liquidation last week, citing extraordinary costs and lack of income.\n\nBolo Fi - Social Affairs Correspondent, RCN News</t>

Though Relalus is an accomplished master of the Kedja form of Fudo he was unprepared for the underhand techniques of the Split who, on the point of being grappled into submission, turned the match sour by ripping the liquid ammonium breathing system off the unfortunate captain. Faron Ceos, a spokesperson for the IGF had this to say about the tragedy, &quot;Although technically it is a &quot;no rules&quot; tournament, there has always been an unspoken agreement about the survival requirements of the various competing species. Regardless, it cannot be said that Shin Zein did anything against the rules and his advancement to the next round was the only possible course of action.&quot; The Split went on to win the tournament, a competition that many are calling &quot;the Split ego trip&quot;.

Some craft have crashed or have made it out of the storm in one piece and made it to the local star ports. The Boron Aid Agency have already dispatched a supply convoy carrying medical equipment and supplies to ship to the surface to help those who have been hit or those who are staying in the main city who can not make it off the surface in time.

The deciding factor in the bid was the discovery of a large, as yet untapped source of Sodium Chloride near to the southern pole of the planet. Sodium Chloride is of course extremely important in the salination process of any colonization plans, and having such a large natural resource greatly reduces the cost. Construction of the salination fabs is likely to start this year, however given the large size of this colony, complete salination will take at least 2 years, meaning that colonisation cannot commence until then. Applicants for the colony should apply through the normal channels; preference as normal will be given to families over single individuals.\n\nBolo Fi - Social Affairs Correspondent, RCN News</t>

The cause of the explosion is unknown at this time, however it is felt by station security to be a highly suspicious incident. It is believed that the blast damaged an area of the trading station`s lower concourse, a section comprising a small market and some bars, where a number of people were going about their business. Casualties were high, with many injured and the fifteen fatalities.\n\nIf the explosion is revealed to be a deliberate strike at the station, rather than some kind of accident, the motive for such an act would be unclear. While the Argon have suffered a number of terrorist incidents in recent years, most have been very clearly targeted at government or military holdings and personnel.

		<t id="1802">The Dragon Incident was a terrible occurrence for the Split people. As the newly inaugurated ship tried to depart from the spacedock, the crew could not have known a small fracture in the reactor casing would cause its imminent doom. The casing that caused the eventual reactor explosion was eventually replaced with a newly designed model, and the ship decommissioned. Even so, many Split pilots still consider the ship to be cursed.\n\n500 Split died in the incident, and today Family Leaders from the lesser families Kaii and T`kr, held a period of remembrance as they stopped working on the ships in the dock. This period of remembrance could be felt across all Split Sectors as all traders stopped for 5 minutes as they paid homage to all those who died in the incident.\n\nYou can find more on the &quot;Dragon Incident&quot; in tonights &quot;Remembering The Dead&quot; only on SFN.\n\nCho`t Lt - Social Affairs Correspondent, SFN News</t>

		<t id="1812">&quot;The Dragon Incident&quot;\n\nSplit Shipyards were always places where convicts would construct quality ships for our people. But this day was a tragedy.\nFive Hundred Split workers from the Family Kaii and T`kr were killed as the station exploded when its newest ship attempted to depart. The Dragon heralded a new dawn for the Split people, but a fracture in its reactor casing caused a catastrophic explosion that resulted in the destruction of three other ships in construction.\n\nPrimary construction moved several jumps away to the nearest shipyards. Plans were drawn up to build a new series of shipyards, including smaller docks in case such an event should ever happen again. Kaii and T`kr never recovered after the death of their workers, and Family T`kr were held responsible for the reactor explosion. The leader of Family T`kr was executed and half of its assets seized. Kaii lost nothing as they were employed to assist T`kr.\n\nConstruction of the Dragon re-started, the first two of the Mk II prototypes were lost in unknown circumstances and, a third ship disappeared without a trace. Split pilots consider the Dragon to be eternally cursed and haunted by the souls of those who died in the incident and haunted by the souls of those who died in the incident. Every year on the anniversary of the explosion, all Split spend five minutes remembering the dead.\n\nGu`t Nnt - Documentary Writer, SFN News</t>

Again, you may think that this is the norm, and indeed, you would be right to assume that some of the contestants are killed as part of the contest. But we are not talking about contestant deaths, because the Ghok managed to leap the protection barriers and into the spectators. With no defence \(all weapons are removed from spectators upon entering the arena\), the Ghok simply set about killing as many as it could. It took almost 20 minutes before the Ghok was finally killed by security and in that time, it managed to kill 71 and injured or maimed 362 others.\n\nThis is only the first estimate of the damage caused, secondary infections have yet to set in and doctors consider that the number of spectator deaths could rise to over 100. At this stage, the game authorities have yet to determine how the Ghok managed to get over the shield that forms part of the protection barrier, but inside sources state that the barrier hasn`t been switched on during games for many months, due to a lack of funds.

Argons, certainly those that come, seem interested in the finer points of the sport and behave respectfully towards our traditions.\n\nEgi t`Rcss, Chief Deathmatch Referee for Family Pride sector, said &quot;It is gratifying that Argons take such an interest in out traditional sport. While I would not class them with Split, I am aware they are decent fighters and perhaps it is not too surprising. As long as they behave with honour, I am pleased to see them in the arena audiences.&quot; It is estimated that Argon tourism in Split sectors, most of which is connected to Ghok Deathmatches, brought in over 36 million credits last year and this is expected to increase substantially over the current year.\n\nJarac t`Mttj - Sports Correspondent, SFN News</t>

The honour of hosting the festival has fallen to Family Chin once again and the decision was taken to hold the event in the Clouds in order to boost the profile of that sector.\n\nThe title of Paramount Gladiator will once more be for the taking and famed gladiators such as Yla t`Rqlm, Huhmyq t`Ftzs and Ohoth t`Twcc will be travelling to the Rhonkar`s Clouds Grand Arena on the main planet. Together with the honour of the title is a purse of 3,000,000 credits.\n\nEvents include a variety of match styles and weapon combinations. The traditional single combat with knives and axes will of course be featured. The exciting double Ghok with shock-staffs are planned for both professional and amateur completions. Also in the line-up will be triple Ghok with semi-automatic pistols, a new and most popular variant of our ancient sport.\n\nJarac t`Mttj - Sports Correspondent, SFN News</t>

		<t id="2122">Renowned Gladiator Toque t`Fttf has announced his retirement from the sport in an extraordinary and unprecedented statement. The five times Paramount Gladiator is now in his 70th year of professional deathmatching and has confirmed that it will be his last. No professional gladiator has previously retired in the history of the sport. It has been a universal rule that professionals die in the arena. However, no previous professional has survived beyond 54 years of deathmatching, let alone 70.\n\nIt is a mark of the skill of Toqaw t`Fvtt that he has reached this stage. It is said that the doughty fighter was persuaded to retire by the Professional Deathmatchers Club. They have offered him a contract as supervisor of a planned academy of deathmatchers. No shame devolves on Toqaw t`Fvtt, particularly as he fights with a prosthetic leg and arm. The PDC may be concerned that a way for older deathmatchers to retire should be established. A number of professionals are heading towards 70 years of deathmatching and the Club is concerned to retain their experience to the benefit of all Split.\n\nJarac t`Mttj - Sports Correspondent, SFN News</t>

		<t id="2132">Many of you may own a Nowhey. For those of you that don`t, this clever little planet-designed gadget was aimed at hot-headed Split everywhere. Being a mighty warrior and a little short tempered is not always a good combination! So the Nowhey was designed. Made from innovative flexible materials, it is about half the size of a Split and virtually indestructible. In a moment of rage, it can be stabbed, punched, kicked, bitten and even whipped against a bulkhead and it will not break. It was designed to let angry Split take out their vengeance and temper without hurting anyone or damaging anything. Sadly, the plan has backfired. It seems that most Split are even more furious at not being able to damage the Nowhey, and have started looking for the next best thing, notably each other. After a three fold increase in fatalities in the last week alone, the Nowhey has now been withdrawn from sale and all use of them banned in public places. This should be a lesson to all Split - a warrior`s spirit can never be subdued.\n\nCho`t Lt - Social Affairs Correspondent, SFN News</t>

		<t id="2152">During the past two weeks, a heavy concentration of attacks against Xenon in their home sectors has taken place. Never straying far from the jump gates, Split forces were able to destroy many smaller Xenon craft before jumping back to safety prior to attack by a Xenon capital ship. Contrary to popular belief, this is not a cowardly way for the Split to fight, but merely using the appropriate tactics for this situation - pilots were keen to emphasize this.\n\nThe attacks were made in a successful attempt to stem similar style raids by the Xenon into Split sectors. Whilst this will work over the short term, the ultimate goal is of course to destroy the Xenon Shipyard. No such attempt was made during this recent assault. Over 30 Xenon ships have been destroyed so far, and military commanders are hailing this as a great victory. Unconfirmed reports put Split fatalities at less than 5.

A number of ships have been damaged and it is even said that the trading station itself was affected by the discharge.\n\nThe phased shockwave generator technology is the result of research by Paranid scientists and functionaries of the Profit Guild, with our weapons experts taking a leading role. The weapon has been successfully adapted for use with a variety of ships and is useful in anti-missile and multiple ship encounter roles.\n\nTeladi Profit Guild spokesmatron Agaras Hertzaris Julias II told us &quot;this incident is probably the result of a single pilot`s error.

The report is a bit sketchy on why a Teladi TL ship hired Boron fighters but it has been confirmed that Paranid fighters were warned to stay away from the ship as it had a bad radiation leak.\n\nThe floating TL had clearly been involved in a battle that damaged the engines and that would explain why it did not have fighters of its own and was drifting. After further talks with the Boron fighters they said, &quot;The attackers fled as soon as they arrived&quot;. Paranid Police have no choice but to let the TL drift further out into deep space and destroy it. Teladi representatives have been notified of this and all scanned data on the vessel has been sent to them. Paranid Police do not know what it was carrying, as the cargo hull was destroyed.

		<t id="2222">The well-known theologian and commentator Geomanckolok has described as &quot;insulting to the race&quot; the suggestion that &quot;unknown Paranid&quot; may be behind the fires raging on Nyana`s Planet in the Argon system of Nyana`s Hideout. The fires on the Argon planet have devastated large portions of the forests of that world and there are believed to have been a number of deaths. The Argon government has made no direct accusation or even hinted at the involvement of any external power. Even so, sources in Nyana`s Hideout have whispered that a &quot;foreign power&quot; was &quot;jealous&quot; of the fine and exotic woods of Nyana`s Planet. This has been taken to be a reference to the Priest Dukes and their natural concern to maintain the majaglit industry and in particular the fine inlaid furniture trade.\n\nWhile the Priest Dukes have denied the possibility of any Paranid involvement in the possible arson on Nyana`s Planet, they have not issued any further comment and are believed to be reluctant to make an issue out of the accusation given that it is not coming from the Argon government itself. Even so, says Geomanckolok, the Argon should &quot;apologise for this vicious slur and make reparations.

		<t id="2232">The civil war between the Southern Continental States government and the self-styled Alliance of Free States on the independent Olmancketslat`s World threatens to spiral out of control with the news that a contingent of Split troops is to travel to the planet at the invitation of the SCS government. The planet, in independent Olmancketslat`s Treaty sector, has long been settled by a variety of renegades and refugees from the space powers. Argon, Paranid, Split and Teladi individuals and families have established cities and independent provinces in profusion across the face of the planet. Only Boron malcontents are lacking in numbers due to the somewhat arid atmosphere of the world.\n\nThe official view of the Paranid Empire and the Priest Dukes on behalf of the Priest Emperor is that the war is of little consequence to Paranid interests. The sector does not sit astride any unique routes across space, indeed has always been something of a side market for the Paranid Empire`s merchants. For whatever reason the Split Families appear to regard it as important enough to send troops there. Alternatively, some observers of the Split have suggested that the troops are being so readily sent in order to give them combat experience. It seems likely that the troops will gain that in abundance as it is reported that the AFS rebels are hiring off-world mercenaries specialising in ground combat. The AFS control a number of resource-rich regions and appear well able to finance large mercenary armies. The Split involvement is by no means a guarantee of a quick end to this war.\n\nLoakmanckelong - Foreign Affairs Correspondent, IPN News</t>

A thorough search of the ship revealed an unusual series of scorch marks around the breaches. Sections of hull have been sent for analysis and pattern matching.\n\nA search of the ships log identified the trader as Margo Smit, a regular on the Seizewell - Kingdom End run. What she was doing so far off course is still not understood. Further analysis of recordings and log entries is being carried out. Pilots are warned against approaching unknown vessels and requested to inform authorities of any ship seen to be acting suspiciously.\n\nLoakmanckeldong - Foreign Affairs Correspondent, IPN News</t>

As more than one government claims jurisdiction over Sudomas because of the crimes committed, it had been decided that if she should ever be caught that she should be tried for her crimes in her home system of Seizewell.\n\nA heavily armoured convoy of Argon and Paranid ships set off from Emperor Mines on the long journey to Seizewell. The journey passed without incident until the convoy reached Menelaus Frontier when it was ambushed. In the ensuing melee Sudomas managed to escape her guards and was last reported heading towards the South gate.\n\nA bounty of 20,000 Cr has been put on her head, dead or alive.

Head of Nostrop Partners Amalgamated Dasinos Ruteos Gustiosanis VIII is top of the list for a second year running with her astounding total of 782.7 billion credits. Noted private entrepreneur Yohindras Hiroglissis Zuzuamis III manages to come in second with a hefty 725.3 billion and third is CEO of Seizewell to Ianamus Zura Transhipping Sintorias Goeosos Trosilius V with a notable 707.1 billion credits. The Teladi Blues phenomenon Tzezzis Tumuleos Bassius I has managed to amass some 192.3 billion in earnings from recordings and tours and is the richest artist or musician on the list.\n\nIn total, Teladi make up almost 57 percent of the list with total domination of the top 200. In the 70th year of the list, the Teladi maintain the lead in personal profit. It is said in some quarters that Teladi business practices skew the list in our race`s favour. However the Profit Guild has stated that its policy of encouraging large individual fortunes as a bulwark against corporate failure will continue. It is interesting to note several new entries from the Argon and Boron sectors this year, with the Boron edging just ahead of the Argon in terms of numbers of entries.\n\nOlaloes Pusndees Yahanis IV - Economics Correspondent, CBNN News</t>

		<t id="2832">Amateur gambling champion Gradias Hilibis Trantaeos IV has lost 15 million credits not in a game of Roulestar or Teladi Eye but in the failure of a bankrupt Argon mining operation in Treasure Chest sector. The erstwhile millionaire had recently tripled her longstanding fortune of approximately 5 million credits in an extraordinary run of luck at the Roulestar tables of Ianamus Zura Casino. The tale becomes murky from this point onwards.\n\nTrantaeos claims she was approached by an Argon venture capitalist calling himself Max Enron and that he persuaded her to invest in a mining operation recently set up in the Argon colony of Treasure Chest. Trantaeos says the group were chasing rich seams of silicon but other sources suggest tales of wealth beyond measure duped the gambler. &quot;It`s the same old con,&quot; said an anonymous source. &quot;She was duped by tales of Nividium in them thar asteroids! There were only a few scraggly seams of silicon and metal ore of course. Her investment has disappeared and Max Enron, whoever he was, has disappeared with it!&quot;\n\nGradias Hilibis Trantaeos IV denies that there was talk of Nividium and has petitioned the Profit Guild to make representations to the Argon colonial government in Treasure Chest. At this time the Guild has declined to comment on the affair.\n\nYlelyis Utequos Ecaques VII - Gaming Correspondent, CBNN News</t>

They have started a strategy of allowing trading pirates to pass until they buy their products and then they attack, collecting any leftovers for profit. Clearly hostile pirates are shot on sight.

The terrain surrounding the volcano is exceedingly fertile and a number of large Sun Oil flower plantations had been established in order to make the system self-sufficient in Nostrop. This would have enabled all space-based farming and processing to go to the export market.\n\nIt is estimated that in excess of 5,000 are dead, with many tens of thousands injured. The plantations were established as new commercial communities and workers and their families were resident on the farms. The initial eruption blasted the plantations of the lower slopes with a pyroclastic cloud, killing all in the area almost instantly. Outer plantations were devastated by lava flows and seismic shocks, which led to the majority of injuries.\n\nThere are indications that poorly-built worker blocks in the outer plantations collapsed and killed several hundred while injuring many thousands. The area of the plantations exceeds 50,000 square kilometres in an area around the titanic Ianamus Mons crater. The circumference of the lower edge of the volcano slopes is over 100 kilometres.\n\nKetimas Etequis Uiiquys V - Outer Worlds Correspondent, CBNN News</t>

They don`t know it could easily bring even death to them&quot;\n\nSo we appeal to the all Teladi public - &quot;Please, if you feel uncomfortable, tired, fatigue, you have spent already a long time in space - take a rest for a couple of hours. This will help you and other creatures in the surrounding area or if you`re in journey - you will bring more safety to other pilots of any kind&quot;.\n\nTzessosis Hoaenos Holigis V - Social Affairs Correspondent, CBNN News</t>

		<t id="3552">A plan to defraud the noted Random Profit Casino on the major planet of New Income has been foiled by agents of the Gaming Profit Directorate. The Random is a centre for Roulestar and Teladi Eye gamers who like the risk of playing in a relatively unregulated atmosphere. Unfortunately, the Random is famous for attracting card sharks, game counters and outright cheats and thieves.\n\nThe latest plot involved the use of a high-powered nanocomputer and a number of secretly positioned graviton beams. The gang, a mix of rogue technicians and well-known casino shakers, planned to use this setup to analyse and influence the workings of the house`s numerous Roulestar tables with subtle pulses of gravitons.\n\nIt is thought the scheme`s equipment will have cost several million credits. However, as the house limit at the Random Profit is one billion credits, the plotters stood to make enormous, if illegal, profits.\n\nYlelyis Utequos Ecaques VII - Gaming Correspondent, CBNN News</t>

The Joint Caravan was a plan to run armed convoys through independent and outer territories using Teladi and Boron naval vessels.\n\nThe scheme was conceived by Profit Protection Admiral Betndyis Ylyliys Bywumys V and she commented: &quot;The Boron Royal Navy is obsessed with its rigid notions of command and loyalty to the Crown. We Teladi respect the Boron Crown but cannot allow the archaic views of Royal Officers to result in loss of profits. The Teladi-Boron Joint Caravan is indefinitely suspended.&quot;\n\nThe Central All-Teladi Stock Exchange rallied at the news, an indication of the market`s dissatisfaction with the plan as a whole and its relief that the project is suspended.

		<t id="3592">During last week, an explosion ripped through the lower concourse of an Argon trading station in Light of Heart Sector killing a number of people. While some have suggested this was caused by maintenance failures, the hot theory is that a terrorist or mercenary faction has carried out a bombing. Argon security is hunting for any and all leads that could point to one group over another. It is reported that the Argon are even looking hard at the activities of the other powers, though it is highly unlikely that even the Split would directly sponsor an attack on an Argon station.\n\nWhile it would be highly embarrassing for the Argon authorities if this explosion does turn out to be the result of negligence and therefore a simple accident, it would be far more interesting if a terrorist group has decided to embark on a campaign of indiscriminate bombings on targets in Argon space. The latter would tie up many security resources that the Argon are currently relying on in their anti-piracy operations. If this were to happen it could herald many new opportunities in Argon space.\n\nOberon Waellsly - Crime Correspondent, MIN News</t>

		<t id="3602">The well-known Teladi Roulestar gambler Gradias Hilibis Trantaeos IV has become the latest victim of the well-established yet ever fruitful Nividium mine confidence trick. The amateur gambling champion was fleeced for a cool 15 million credits when the mining corporation she had invested in folded leaving several backers without a credit chip to show for it. Trantaeos claims a character called Max Enron who spoke of developing silicon seams in Treasure Chest sector approached her. However, our sources say the gullible gambler was duped by the old tale of Nividium under the rocks.\n\nTrantaeos has asked the Profit Guild to step in but they are known to be unsympathetic when a Teladi foolishly loses every credit in some scheme that goes bankrupt. Even were they to be interested, the Argon authorities in Treasure Chest say they have no record of &quot;Max Enron&quot; and report that the New TC Mining Group was registered using, irony of ironies, a numbered account at the Profit Guild Bank in Seizewell. This account is understood to have been closed down in the last week with all monies gone.\n\nThe sad tale of the Teladi and the Nividium mine is sure to become a favourite in the bars and dives of every sector in space.

		<t id="3611">Gate Race Star Cheated</t>
		<t id="3612">The winner of the last gate race event, famed for having beaten the previous course record by 198 minutes, was found to have cheated. The Teladi pilot, Yalos Trosulis Rungisass II, used a jump drive fitted to her modified Boron Octopus to skip 4 sectors on the course. The usual punishment for cheating during a race is for the offender to be released into a planetary atmosphere to burn to death. This punishment was avoided however, as three of the other race pilots tracked down the cheating Teladi and destroyed her ship, killing her instantly. In the absence of the original &quot;winner&quot;, the prize of 10,000 credits was awarded to the pilot who was the first to finish without cheating, a Paranid pilot named Sao`t Sht. The bonus of 5,000 credits for beating the course record has been returned to the race organisers.\n\nIn related news, it would appear that gate race pilots are improving in skill. After a season of races where the average number of competitor deaths from collisions was 25, and the individual races never had less than 12, it is interesting to note that the last race only contained 4 deaths. This includes the death of Yalos Trosulis Rungisass II, the cheating Teladi pilot. A good example of evolution at work.\n\nVal Gisler - Sports Correspondent, MIN</t>

The TS class vessel carrying the precious liquid was totally destroyed and a number of nearby vessels were damaged. The cargo-carrier had just backed off from a collision with another ship when it exploded in a vast fireball. Sheets of flame are said to have washed over nearby vessels and the explosive force was such that a number suffered shield failures and damage ranging from the minor to the severe. It is suspected that the crash caused electrical faults to develop in the hold and somehow these ignited the Space Fuel.\n\nThe collision took place outside the pirate base in Nyana`s Hideout and follows a number of near misses and other space traffic incidents in and around the station. The reputation for lax control that the Hideout base has gained is hardly likely to be helped by this disaster. Said barkeeper Egon Watney, &quot;This is an absolute disaster!

		<t id="3862">Scientists on the Fairwather team have been reportedly split in their opinions as to the results of the materials taken from the structure on Regcalus V. Speculation is rife that the structure is not manufactured but more of a naturally weathered piece of metal rich volcanic rock. Aaron Fairwather has refused to speculate and is determined that the team must proceed with a proper excavation of the site.\n\nThe weather patterns in the area are reportedly going to get worse with a major sandstorm expected within the next two days.\n\nIon Gren - Science Correspondent, IBC News</t>

Most of the crew have been taken to a safe orbit. Just a few remained to monitor events and ensure that the equipment remains intact.\n\nAnalysis of the materials still proved inconclusive as to the origin of the structure on the surface. Sand removers and deflectors will be deployed as soon as the storms have cleared. This will allow the deep excavation to start.\n\nIon Gren - Science Correspondent, IBC News</t>

The sand removers then shifted over three thousand units of sand so that the group could examine the base of the structure.

		<t id="3892">In the early morning of the Regcalus V moon the Argon Military detected a brief broadcasted message as the Fairwather team uncovered the edges of what now appears to be a large Xenon signal transmission dish. Suspecting a potential threat, five troop-drop carriers and twenty planetary assault ships landed and deployed around the camp. They extracted the team by force and destroyed a section of the dish before it was realized the dish was no longer functioning.\n\nThe damage to the dish was significant and a formal complaint was issued to the authorities for the heavy-handed use of military arms in a technologically sensitive area. Aaron Fairwather remained optimistic that he may still be able to salvage some of the Xenon technology for further examination\n\nJo Springer - Social and Culture Correspondent, IBC News</t>

		<t id="3932">Forty five tourists from the sector Ringo Moon were given a spectacular tour of the famous Goner Temple. &quot;Noah explained everything&quot; said one tourist, &quot;Noah went into great detail of our ancestry. It was unbelievable, we never knew there was so much information available about it.&quot; Noah`s final tour took the tourists to the holographic room, where they were shown the short holofilm that was found on an asteroid a long time ago in the old sector of Rhonkar`s Clouds. The tourists were amazed and in a way sad at the way the earth was befallen by the chaos of war with the terraformers, and how they got the name of Argon. Derived from Nathan R. Gunn, the captain of the fleet that tricked the terraformers to follow them through a secret gate that was later destroyed. The group was awed at the chase that lead the earth fleet through many sectors in this universe. Some were in tears at the way the earth fleet was gradually picked off one by one by the evil terraformers, now known as the Xenon. The final crash by the remaining ship from the earth fleet and how they finally settled down on Argon Prime.\n\nMany tourists had never heard of the earth test pilot that ended up stranded in the Teladi sector of Seizewell, and how his ship had got here without the use of a jump drive. Kept secret for many years by many governments, they learned how he had found the holographic data disk in the old sector of Rhonkar`s clouds, which the earth pilot had returned to the Goners, the final battle that took the races to final victory over the Xenon, and how they kept the Xenon in retreat to now form the current shape of the universe.\n\nNoah Gaffelt later said, &quot;I always love the final part of the tour, as the tourists watch in horror at the holographic movie, it`s a tragedy and in a way gives us many lessons to learn about the war which befell earth. Noah later held mass in honour of the brave earth fleet.&quot;\n\nJo Springer - Social And Culture Correspondent, IBC News</t>

		<t id="3972">With the conclusion of the 5th IGF tournament, the debate in the church over this competition seems to have found an equilibrium. In an effort to conclude this argument and gain more knowledge of the tournament which our conservative brothers are calling `a brutal excuse for the conflict of war without the political implications` and which continues to divide our brotherhood a Goner Chiun Ta Cho master, Master Hwange was entered as an Argon competitor. As you all know the art Chiun Ta Cho is practiced among us to preserve the body and calm the spirit and has no direct connection with violence of any kind. Nonetheless Master Hwange was able to defeat his first opponent the Paranid, Falix Halifalix by methodically avoiding his blows for 17 hours before Falix collapsed of exhaustion. Master Hwange then forfeited his place in the competition by refusing to face fellow Argon, Nathan Gunner.\n\nIt is uncertain what experiences Master Hwange will share with us when he returns but it is certain that while our brotherhood is divided over this issue we must remember that it is our only difference and that we may disagree here and remain united in other things, preserving our order, as we have done in less fortunate centuries than this one.\n\nJo Springer - Social and Culture Correspondent, IBC News</t>

		<t id="3982">An unofficial debate is raging around the Goner temple today concerning beards. At present, there is of course no obligation to grow a beard as a Goner, yet most choose to do so as it is traditional. Clean-shaven Goners argue that they are being discriminated against - all the high council have beards and infact there has never been a clean shaven Goner elected to this lofty position. The beard brigade dismiss this as nonsense, and have suggested that if the clean shaven Goners spent more time worshipping and studying instead of worrying about facial hair, then maybe they would in time become more worthy of a council position. Divisions within the Goner ranks have not been so strong since the debate concerning colour scheme for the redecoration of the toilets on C Deck last year.

		<t id="3992">A vigorous debate was held yesterday concerning the appearance of Goner`s ships on radars. The debate is unfortunately, and un-characteristically, divided down the middle. The conservative members of the temple wish to see no changes, and are proud of the distinctive way that Goner ships are displayed on other pilot`s radar. They feel as missionaries spreading the word of R Gunn that they should stand out from other space traffic. The progressives however feel that this distinctiveness is the very reason that so many Goner ships have been attacked or captured of late, and that these attacks are hindering the word being spread around the universe. This debate is likely to go on for several months, but don`t expect to see any changes in the near future.\n\nIon Gren - Science Correspondent, GCN News</t>

Normal ambient temperatures and steady artificial light are being replaced by torrential rain, mini-heat waves \(Boron visitors beware\), snow, hail and high winds. This testing is essential to progress the development of our new atmosphere converter. Horticulturists can be reassured that all plants in the Gardens are protected and in no danger. If you should become stuck in the gardens in the middle of a storm, we recommend taking shelter under the distinctive Olient Tree. When faced with changing weather, this tree quickly lowers its branches to form a protective shield around its trunk whilst it evaluates how to adapt to its new environment. Most races should be able to shelter there until assistance arrives.\n\nTome Smit, Weather Office, GCN News</t>

Taking a step closer to the divine and free use of a company vehicle more than makes up the lack of competitive pay. Key roles of a missionary will be to spread the word of R Gunn and bring peace and harmony to a chaotic universe.

Using very highly focussed matter transporters, the team has demonstrated the ability to remove and implant matter into the body of any given person. The surgical applications for such a method are almost without limit and can be used with any species.\n\nDoctor Katarin Delayn said: &quot;This is truly a great advance. With this technique of micro-matter transmission we can remove harmful cells, such as cancers, and deliver useful matter, such as targeted drugs or medical implants, without open surgery. Imagine the benefits!&quot;\n\nDoctor Delayn described for GCN how the procedure had been tested using volunteers drawn from the Goner faith: &quot;We have sought at all times to be consensual and have refrained from animal testing. However, there are clearly animal healthcare applications as well as those for sentient races.&quot; It may be several years before the technology is widespread as the costs will initially be high and safeguards are yet to be worked out.

The results of the latest survey of belief systems in Boron space have shown that there is a steady increase in Boron membership of the Goners. A mark of our increasing numbers has been the construction of minor temples in the oceans of Kingdom`s End and Queen`s Space, where there are now large communities. It is hoped a minor temple can be built in the Lucky Planets sector, which is a centre of Boron Goners in the new territories.\n\nThe free and welcoming atmosphere found throughout Boron space is a boon to our faith and the Goners are grateful for the enlightened rule of Queen Atreus and Her Royal Government. Elsewhere in the universe the story is very different with Paranid and Split Brothers and Sisters persecuted for joining us in the Goner Way.

		<t id="4072">It is with great sadness yet joy for his life that we report the death at 276 years of Brother Vega Marais, one of the most able of Goner philosophers and a great humorist and wit in our community. Marais was born on Argon in the Herron`s Nebula sector and made a life for himself as a fighter pilot. He took part in many engagements and several of the border wars that have cursed our age. A chance encounter with one of our brothers, whose name is not known, changed the life of Brother Marais. He travelled to the Great Temple in Cloudbase South West and duly decided to follow the Goner Way.\n\nIn the course of his life with us, Brother Marais became famous for his metaphysical jokes and perplexing questions. Famously he asked a Split warrior, visiting the Temple as part of the then Split Ambassador`s entourage, &quot;How sharp is a sword with no blade?&quot; Much taken with this, the Split warrior went away. Several months later, that warrior, Kao `t Pst, became the first Split to follow the Goner Way.\n\nBrother Marais had a great sense of humour and while he could publish such masterworks as Philosophical Investigations into the Hidden Universe, he could also produce the famed and much-loved No Joke Left Unturned, acknowledged by many professional comedians as a fund of material. The Goner Brotherhood is the poorer for his passing but immeasurably richer for his life.\n\nJo Springer - Social and Culture Correspondent, GCN News</t>

Constantly pressured to stand for the High Council, he declined on numerous opportunities, saying his preaching work was more important. This won him enormous respect from all Goners. Rolf is the first missionary for over 4 years to die of natural causes \(all others being killed or captured whilst flying\) and he will be well remembered by all of us. Donations for his remembrance will be gratefully received by the temple \(denominations of 10 credits only please\).

		<t id="4092">It is a sad fact of life that Goner ships are seen as easy prey, and often both the ship and pilot are captured, the latter often sold off as slaves for the mining corporations in Split sectors. Whilst we are completely opposed to slavery, particularly of our own, it is interesting to note that this has resulted in more conversions to our faith. It seems that our captured missionaries have continued to preach the faith to their fellow slaves, who are converting in their droves. Rumour has it that the Split mine owners are concerned about this, but cannot stop the religion spreading as every time they try to suppress it, another martyr to the cause is born. It is extremely gratifying to know that the Goner faith is helping so many slaves come to terms with their conditions now. Of course, the High Council expects that any Goner pilot captured in future also acts in a similar fashion and continues to spread the word of R Gunn no matter what the circumstances.\n\nJo Springer - Social and Culture Correspondent, GCN News</t>

The High Council had taken all races by surprise when they entered this year, the `honoured` Goner being Jes Ramussen. It was thought that this experiment would promote greater understanding and conversion within the Split race, plus Jes Ramussen was convinced that his faith would allow him to overcome the fearsome Ghok without the need for violence. Entering the arena in an almost trance-like state, the contest ultimately lasted just under two minutes, and then only that long as the Ghok appeared to have trouble swallowing Ramussen`s clothing in addition to the rest of his body \(Goner robes are quite prickly and itchy\).

		<t id="4132">The High Council within the Goner Temple has revived the debate over whether or nor captured Goner ships should be allowed to be sold at shipyards across the universe. They argue that the sale or purchase of Goner ships should be made illegal, as they could only have been sourced by illegal means. Shipyard owners disagree, saying that this would stifle the free-market liberal trading economy that the races have worked so hard to establish, and would set a precedent that could lead to other products being banned as well. The debate was sparked after the High Council released the astonishing figures for last year, reporting a loss of 207 ships, and after new ship production, a net loss of 45 ships. This has prompted the High Council to demand that captured ships be returned to the Goners and their former owners prosecuted. The shipyard owners have adamantly refused this, in the interests of the confidentiality of their clients.\n\nMiria Gisler - Communications Correspondent, GCN News</t>

		<t id="4142">It is only now emerging that Goner Intelligence was involved in the recent interception of mercenary terrorists planning to attack the Argon Trading Port in Home of Light. The mercenaries, who had all knowledge of their employers chemically wiped out, were to use a matter transporter to deliver a primed Hornet class missile into the main concourse of the station. If such a weapon were to detonate in an unshielded area of that kind it would tear the facility apart.\n\nGoner Intelligence have long monitored the whereabouts of matter transmission devices and became concerned some months ago, when a transmat-equipped Teladi vessel was reported lost to a pirate attack. It now appears that agents of Goner Intelligence were successfully able to trace the device and pass on the information to Argon authorities.\n\nWhile the mercenaries have no memory of their employers, they were able to name a numbered account at the Teladi Profit Guild Bank in Company Pride. Argon agents found the account to be empty after obtaining a warrant from Guild authorities. The Teladi factor in the affair has been noted but seems nothing more than circumstantial at this time. No motives for such a vicious attack on a trading station other than to create sheer terror has been discovered.\n\nBal Mulligan - Security Correspondent, GCN News</t>
